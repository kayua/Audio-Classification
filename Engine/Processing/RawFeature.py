class RawDataLoader(WindowGenerator):
    """
    A class for loading and processing audio data for machine learning models.

    This class inherits from the `WindowGenerator` class and is designed to load and
    preprocess audio data, typically for tasks such as classification. It supports
    reading audio files from a directory, extracting raw features, and
    normalizing the data. It also generates sliding windows over the audio signal
    for training purposes.

    Attributes:
        @sample_rate (int): The sample rate for loading the audio files.
        @window_size (int): The size of the window for segmenting the audio signal.
        @overlap (int): The amount of overlap between adjacent windows.
        @window_size_factor (int): The factor for segmenting the audio into smaller windows during preprocessing.
        @file_extension (str): The file extension of the audio files to load (e.g., '.wav').

    Methods:
        @load_data(sub_directories: str, file_extension: Optional[str] = None) -> tuple:
            Loads the audio data from the specified directories and processes it into spectrogram features and labels.
        @get_class_paths(parent_directory: str) -> list:
            Returns the list of class directories in the parent directory.
        @process_all_classes(class_paths: list, file_extension: str) -> tuple:
            Processes all classes by iterating over their respective directories.
        @process_class_directory(class_path: str, file_extension: str) -> tuple:
            Processes a single class directory by loading and processing its audio files.
        @process_file(file_name: str) -> tuple:
            Processes a single audio file, extracting features and labels from it.
        @extract_label_from_path(file_path: str) -> int:
            Extracts the class label from the file path based on the directory structure.
        @segment_and_normalize(segment: numpy.ndarray) -> numpy.ndarray:
            Segments and normalizes an audio segment (patch) for further processing.

    Example:
        >>> python
        ...     # Initialize the DataLoader instance
        ...     data_loader = RawDataLoader(
        ...     raw_feature_sample_rate=22050,   # Standard audio sample rate
        ...     raw_feature_window_size=1024,    # Window size for segmentation
        ...     raw_feature_overlap=512,         # Overlap between windows
        ...     raw_feature_window_size_factor=2,  # Factor for splitting segments into smaller windows
        ...     raw_feature_file_extension='.wav'  # File extension for audio files
        ...     )
        ...

        ...     # features: numpy array of spectrograms (processed audio data)
