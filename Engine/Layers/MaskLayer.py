class MaskCreator:

    A utility class for creating masks for sequence data.

    Methods
    -------
    create(seq_len: int) -> tf.Tensor
        Creates a lower triangular mask (causal mask) for sequences.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def create_mask(seq_len: int) -> tensorflow.Tensor:
        """
        Creates a lower triangular mask for causal attention.

        This mask is commonly used in transformer models to prevent a position
        from attending to future positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        seq_len : int
            The length of the sequence.

        Returns
        -------
        mask : tf.Tensor
            A tensor of shape (seq_len, seq_len) with ones in the lower triangle and zeros elsewhere.
