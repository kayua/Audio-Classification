class QuantizationLayer(Layer):
    """
    Custom TensorFlow layer that performs vector quantization on the input data.
    The layer finds the nearest clusters (centroids) to each input vector and replaces
    the input with the average of the closest reference points (centroids). This process
    is commonly used in tasks like data compression, image segmentation, and feature learning.

    Vector Quantization (VQ) involves mapping input vectors to a finite set of representative
    centroids (also known as codebook vectors or cluster centroids). The input is then replaced
    by the centroid closest to it, based on a distance metric (typically Euclidean).

    Reference:
        The concept of vector quantization is widely used in signal processing and data compression.
        "Vector Quantization and Signal Compression" by R. M. Gray and D. L. Neuhoff, 1998.
        This technique is also closely related to K-Means clustering, where the centroids serve
        as the quantized representations of the data.

    Args:
        number_clusters (int): The number of nearest clusters (centroids) to consider during quantization.
                               This is the number of centroids to be considered for each input.
                               Default is 5.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent Layer class.

    Attributes:
        built_point (bool): Indicates whether the layer has been built.
        reference_points (tf.Variable): A variable representing the reference points (centroids) used
            in the quantization process. These centroids are fixed (non-trainable) and are shared
            between the KNNLayer and the QuantizationLayer.
        knn_layer (KNNLayer): An instance of the KNNLayer that is used to find the nearest clusters (centroids).
        number_k_clusters (int): The number of clusters to use for quantization. It determines how many centroids
                 to consider for each input vector.

    Example:
        >>> # Create a QuantizationLayer with 5 clusters
        ...     quant_layer = QuantizationLayer(number_clusters=5)
        ...     # Sample input tensor (batch_size=3, input_dim=4)
        ...     inputs = tf.random.normal((3, 4))
        ...     # Build the QuantizationLayer (must be done before calling it)
        ...     quant_layer.build(inputs.shape)
        ...     # Get the quantized output
        ...     quantized_output = quant_layer(inputs)
        ...     print(quantized_output)
        >>>
