Audio Classification using Multiple Neural Network Architectures

This script implements and evaluates multiple neural network architectures for audio classification,
including Wav2Vec2, MLP, Audio Spectrogram Transformer, Conformer, Residual, and LSTM.

It performs the following tasks:
    - Training and evaluation of the models
    - Generation of performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
    - Generation of Confusion Matrix
    - Plotting of the ROC Curve
    - Comparison of models' performance
    - Automatic generation of a final results report

Example Usage:
--------------
Run the script directly from the command line:
    $ python3 main.py

Requirements:
-------------
Ensure that all dependencies are installed using the provided requirements file:
    $ pip3 install --upgrade pip
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
